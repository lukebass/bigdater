1) If we wanted the WikipediaPopular class to return the most popular page, as well as the view count, we would have to modify both our mapper 
and reducer classes. First, the mapper would need to return Text-LongTextPairWritable pairs. This would, therefore, require us to implement a 
LongTextPairWritable class, which implements Writable. This class would allow us to store the view count (Long) and page (Text) pairs, which
we would return, along with the key (Text time field), from the mapper. Next, the reducer would need to accept Text-LongTextPairWritable pairs. 
However we are currently calculating the max view count would also slightly change. We would no longer iterate over a list of LongWritables, to 
determine the max view count, but rather our LongTextWritable pairs. Lastly, the reducer would need to return Text-LongTextPairWritable pairs.

2) The difference between map and flatMap is that the map operation will apply itself to the n elements passed in and will return n elements as 
a result. The flatMap operation will apply itself to the n elements passed in, however, for each element, it may return 0, 1, or more elements
as a result. Take, for example, wordcount-improved. For each line flatMap processes, it may return 0, 1, or more words, depending on how many 
words were on a line. Map is more like the MapReduce concept of mapping: each element is processed and mapped, one by one.

3) The difference between reduce and reduceByKey is that the reduce operation will apply itself to the n elements passed in and will return one 
value as a result. The reduceByKey operation will apply itself to the n key-value pairs passed in and will return one value for each key as a 
result. ReduceByKey is more like the MapReduce conecpt of reducing: only unique keys and their values remain after they are reduced.

4) If we wanted wikipedia_popular.py to return all pages viewed the highest number of times, we would, first, have to implement a function used 
by the reduceByKey call. Instead of returning a views-name tuple, it would instead return a list of tuples for the provided time key, where the 
list contained the highest viewed pages. For each key, we would iterate over the pages and if the current page had views greater than our 
current max, we would empty the list and add this page to our list. However, if the current page had views equal to our current max, we would 
instead add it to our list. Furthermore, we would have to update the outputFormat function to return the time, followed by the list of tuples, 
instead of the time-tuple format it currently outputs.
