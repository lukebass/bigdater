1) For each of the following tests I used the reddit-2 dataset:

Without cache: 25.927s 
With cache: 19.835

2) Caching is useful when our code references an RDD multiple times. With all operations, there is a cost associated with performing them. 
Therefore, caching an RDD that is only referenced once might actually increase the runtime of our program.

3) The broadcast join will be faster than an actual join when the data we are broadcasting is relatively small in size, as it must be stored in 
each executor's memory, and the RDD we are joining it to is large in size. Otherwise a regular join will do.

4) The broadcast join will be slower than an actual join when the data we are broadcasting is relatively large in size, as it must be copied to 
each executor, and the RDD we are joining it to is too small in size to make broadcasting worth it.
